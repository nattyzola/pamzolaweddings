    %p My goal is to make wedding planning fun and organized so that you feel minimal stress and maximum joy. During the planning, I will think of everything! “Everything” includes, but is not limited to, anticipating problems; reviewing budgets and contracts; creating a timeline; acting as an intermediary and skilled communicator between vendors, family members and you; and orchestrating all moving people and pieces. We’ll prioritize and decide where to simplify and where to glamify. I will connect you with vendors who will get your vision, personality and budget – and may even come to feel like your new best friends! As the wedding day approaches, your to-do lists will dwindle down to nothing.  And when the BIG day arrives, I expect to see you calm, joyful and present, with confidence that all will go as planned.
